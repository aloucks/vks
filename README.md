Vulkan bindings and symbol loader for Rust

Latest supported Vulkan specification: 1.0.6 + all extensions

For the time being, vk-sys requires a nightly version of the Rust compiler, because we use the
`struct_field_attributes` and `untagged_unions` features.

## Cargo Features

vk-sys supports very fine grained compile-time configuration via Cargo features. The version of the
core specification and the revision for each extension can be selected individually. Dependencies
between available features are modelled as well. This means, selecting nothing but a single
extension revision (i.e. via `cargo build --no-default-extensions --features khr_wayland_surface_5`)
will still pull in the lowest core specification, that supported that extension (i.e. `core_1_0_3`),
as well as possibly other dependencies (i.e. `khr_surface_25`).

The `default` feature will always select the latest fully supported core Vulkan specification as
well as all extensions, that are supported and have been defined up to that point.

### `vk_*` Features

All of these features select all extensions, that where defined up that point.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `vk_1_0_6` | Vulkan 1.0.6 + all extensions |
| `vk_1_0_5` | Vulkan 1.0.5 + all extensions |
| `vk_1_0_4` | Vulkan 1.0.4 + all extensions |
| `vk_1_0_3` | Vulkan 1.0.3 + all extensions |

### `core_*` Features

These features do not select any extensions.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `core` | Latest supported Vulkan specification |
| `core_1_0_6` | Vulkan 1.0.6 |
| `core_1_0_5` | Vulkan 1.0.5 |
| `core_1_0_4` | Vulkan 1.0.4 |
| `core_1_0_3` | Vulkan 1.0.3 |

### Extension Features
All of these features will (at least) select the lowest required Vulkan specification and possibly
other dependencies.

## Loader

vk-sys includes two convenience Vulkan symbol loaders: `InstanceProcAddrLoader` and
`DeviceProcAddrLoader`. Both support all available core Vulkan functions including extension
function pointers. The exact set of function pointers depend on the enabled Cargo features.

## Supported Vulkan Specifications

 * 1.0.6
 * 1.0.5
 * 1.0.4
 * 1.0.3
